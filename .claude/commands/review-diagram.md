# Review README Diagram

Review the README's Mermaid diagram(s) and reconcile with the actual codebase implementation.

## Task

1. Read the README.md file completely, focusing on any Mermaid diagrams
2. Read the main source files to understand the actual flow and logic
3. Compare the diagram against the code and identify:
   - Features shown in diagram but removed from code
   - Features in code but missing from diagram
   - Flow discrepancies or inaccuracies
4. Provide a detailed report of findings
5. If discrepancies exist, update the diagram to match the current implementation

## Output Format

Summarize findings as:
- ✅ What's correct in the diagram
- ❌ What's missing or incorrect
- Recommended changes with specific line references
